## Introduction

Natural language processing (NLP), in fact, requires highlevel symbolic capabilities

Today, most of the existing approaches are still based on the syntactic representation of text, a method that relies mainly on word cooccurrence frequencies.Such algorithms are limited by the fact that they can process only the information that they can ‘see’. As human text processors, we do not have such limitations as every word we see activates a cascade of semantically related concepts, relevant episodes, and sensory experiences, all of which enable the completion of complex NLP tasks—such as word-sense disambiguation, textual entailment, and semantic role labeling—in a quick and effortless way.

Computational models may provide very specific predictions about human behaviors that can then be explored by the psycholinguist. 

 this review paper focuses on the evolution of NLP research according to three different paradigms, namely: the bag-ofwords, bag-of-concepts, and bag-of-narratives models. Borrowing the concept of ‘jumping curves’ from the field of business management, this survey article explains how and why NLP research has been gradually shifting from lexical semantics to compositional semantics and offers insights on next-generation narrative-based NLP technology.

## 3.Overlapping NLP Curves

 Today, even the most popular NLP technologies view text analysis as a word or pattern matching task. Trying to ascertain the meaning of a piece of text by processing it at wordlevel, however, is no different from attempting to understand a picture by analyzing it at pixel-level.

Relying on arbitrary keywords, punctuation, and word cooccurrence frequencies has worked fairly well so far, but the explosion of UGCs and the outbreak of deceptive phenomena such as web-trolling and opinion spam, are causing standard NLP algorithms to be increasing less efficient. 

In order to properly extract and manipulate text meanings, a NLP system must have access to a significant amount of knowledge about the world and the domain of discourse.

Single-word expressions, however, are just a subset of concepts, multi-word expressions that carry specific semantics and sentics（情感学）, that is, the denotative(外延的)  and connotative(内涵的) information commonly associated with real-world objects, actions, events, and people.

Semantics and sentics include common-sense knowledge and common knowledge.

It is through the combined use of common and common-sense knowledge that we can have a grip on both high- and low-level concepts as well as nuances(细微差别) in natural language understanding and therefore effectively communicate with other people without having to continuously ask for definitions and explanations. 

 In this last model(bag of narratives model), each piece of text will be represented by ministories or interconnected episodes, leading to a more detailed level of text comprehension and sensible computation. While the bag-of-concepts model helps to overcome problems such as word-sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling, the bag-of-narratives model will enable tackling NLP issues such as co-reference resolution and textual entailment.
